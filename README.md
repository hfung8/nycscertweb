I am a graduate student in the Master of Education in Computer Science Program at Hunter College. In the fall I will be interning at the Academy for Software Engineering as a Computer Science Teacher. I am well versed in JavaScript and have learned how to code in Java as well as Python. I have taught at Nuasin Next Generation Charter School as a teacher for Java and Python and also at Quad Preparatory School as a JavaScript teacher. Before getting into teaching I was a TA at Columbia Engineering Coding Bootcamp for over three years. 

When Iâ€™m not working, I am an avid runner and soccer player. I have ran two marathons, and have played in various soccer leagues in NYC.
